            Your privacy is important to us. It is Nipfune App's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across the Nipfune we own and operate.
            
            We ask for personal information only when we really need it to provide you with help.
            We do this by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also tell you why we are collecting it and how it will be used.
            
            We only retain the information collected for as long as necessary to provide the help you requested.
            
            We do not share personally identifiable information publicly or with third parties, except as required by law.
            
            Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of this application and cannot accept responsibility for their respective privacy policies.
            
            
            Your continued use of our App will be deemed acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, please contact us.
            
            More information
            
            We hope that's clear and, as mentioned earlier, if there's something you're not sure whether you need or not, it's generally safer to leave cookies enabled if you interact with one of our apps.
